# IBM-Data-Science-Certfication Project 2019

##### Python packages used : 
1. Pandas, Numpy
2. matplotlib, seaborn
3. sklearn

##### Methods and technics, related to data analysis, used:
1. Data import - pd.read_csv()
2. Data cleaning (columns dropping - df.drop())
3. Spotting outliers with sns.boxplot() and correlation with sns.regplot()
4. Using Linear regression to predict prices. 
5. Calculating R and R^2 for different features.
6. Using Pipeline from sklearn.pipeline to build pipeline ( scaler -> polynomial features -> modeling).
7. Try Ridge regression model for prediction.
8. Performing second order polynomial transform to training data for better score, then RR again.
9. Valuation using train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection.
